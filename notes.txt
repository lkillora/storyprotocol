Onchain Notes (Trade Opportunity Before Feb):
- According to the onchain vesting contracts, there's a massive cliff unlock in February of 62mm units (~$330m) from the vesting contracts.
- Alto pointed out that the Tokenomist has it as linear rather than cliff, so perhaps this is not widely known.
- On top of that, separate tokens locked with the validator also unlock in February (within a couple of days of the other unlock) to the tune of 30mm units (~165m). These are not mentioned at all in the Tokenomist.
- Moreover, in about half a year 75mm units have been emitted, making the inflation rate about 7.5x the stated rate (150mm vs 20mm).

- There is some intentional obfuscation. Beneficiaries of locked tokens are hashed, the genesis balances were widely distributed across over 100 wallets, and there are more than 260 timelock vesting contracts with some being created in the past two weeks even though the schedule matches some of the older ones from February.

~350m units are held in wallets with strong links to the genesis wallets
~200m units were staked from genesis wallets
~250m units were sent to timelock vesting wallets
~80m units are staking rewards owned by the team or investors
~200m units remain
so circulating about 15% (assuming the technically unlocked tokens are non-circulating)
